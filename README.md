# Object Oriented JavaScript for Rubyists

JavaScript is way more powerful, flexible, and object-oriented than most people
think. I know you've heard this statement several times. And most of us dismiss
it without giving much thought. In this talk, I show you the raw power and
flexibility of JavaScript with examples Rubyists can easily relate to.

At the end of the talk, we will have Ruby's object system implemented in
JavaScript. Don't worry, the entire implementation fits into a single slide!
